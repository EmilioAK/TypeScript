<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>
The coverage improved since at first the function was not tested, my test added a test for that fucntion which means it now is tested at thus covered in the tests.

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>

## Statement of individual contributions

Max Raulea: "I wrote some new tests for the 2 functions, clearmeasures() and getduration(), then I tested the coverage of the base64decode() and clearmeasures() function. I also wrote the shared part of the report in the md file as well as my own part"
